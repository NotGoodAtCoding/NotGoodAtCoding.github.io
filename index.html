        <h3>Career Objective</h3>

        <p>After graduation, I hope to be able to start a career as a Software Developer
        in some capacity that allows me to continue to cultivate my skills and has
        avenues for advancement into different specialities. Since I am still unsure about
        what exact speciality I want to pursue, having flexibility and a supportive environment
        are key to my success and I will seek out employers who can offer that.</p>

        <p>Further in the future, I want to be fulfilled by my work and have an impact
        at least at the company I work for and to the clients they service. I hope to
        eventually become as helpful a mentor to the less experienced as I have had during
        my internships.</p>
