        <h2>Senior Design - Accupop</h2>

        <h5>Project Definition</h5>

        <p>In baseball, “pop-time” is the time it takes from the moment that a
            baseball hits a catcher’s mitt to the moment the ball hits the glove
            of the second basemen. This is one of the most important ways the skill
            level of a catcher can be assessed by a scout [5]. The most commonly
            used method for obtaining pop-time is by using a stopwatch to time
            the throw it. This is a very inaccurate process and renders results
            with an error of .2 seconds, which is a very large error when the
            average pop-time is around 2 seconds. Therefore, a better method for
            accurately recording the pop-time is needed. The goal of this project
            is to accurately measure the time it takes for a catcher to throw a
            ball down to second base, and then display that time on an app and website.</p>

        <h5>My Role</h5>

        <p>My role on the team is WebMaster, which means that I am in charge of the
        work tracking and repository management for the team, as well as the final
        project website app, the Android app, and the iOS app.</p>

        <h5>My Contribution</h5>

        <p>I have contributed my knowledge of React and React native frameworks as well
        as knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, JSX, CSS, and Google AppEngine to this project
        to help provide a solid foundation for the application. I also contributed my
        website system design skills to create a robust and logical API for use in
        interfacing simply with the hardware components of the app being worked on by
        my other group members.</p>
