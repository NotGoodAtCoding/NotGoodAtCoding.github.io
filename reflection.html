        <h3>MATH 490</h3>
        <p>This course was one of the core factors in my decision to pursue a minor
        in mathematics. I learned about control of quantum systems as an extension to
        my Differential Equations course, specifically how they applied to fully
        actuated systems and their optimal solutions. For example, take the system
        of a car trying to parallel park; the controls would be the steering wheel,
        gas, gear, and brake and the solution is the car being in the parking spot. The
        task would be to determine an optimal series of inputs to the controls in
        order to reach the solution based on, for example, time. This work greatly
        improved my appreciation for mathematics and has fueled my interest in personal
        projects concerning the discrete application of continuous models, such as very
        simple physics engines.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>LING 119</h3>
        <p>I learned a lot about grammar and was able to apply my knowledge to the field
        of computer languages to some degree after completing this Linguistics course.
        It was interesting to draw parallels between the format of computer and human
        languages in how meaning is conveyed.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>HD FS 276</h3>
        <p>This course, in which I am currently enrolled, has helped broaden my view
        of the human experience and the influence of human sexuality in how to communicate.
        I have also been granted the opportunity to reflect on myself personally and
        identify a side of myself that is more personal than any that I am able to explore
        in other classes, such as the professional side that I can groom in my core
        Software Engineering courses.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>General Education Reflection</h3>

        <p>As I approach graduation, I am seeking a full time position at a company where I
        can continue to improve on my technical and professional skills. No matter which
        company ends up being able to provide me this opportunity, I hope to be able to
        reach my full potential and be able to advance and continue to operate at a
        capacity that fits my skills. Past this, I hope to be able to find fulfillment in
        the work that I do and be able to enjoy the culture and community of my workplace.</p>

        <p>My general education classes help me gain greater insight into the various
        perspectives from which to view a problem. I can use the information that I gained
        from my advanced mathematical course in order to attempt to optimize a solution
        for a user, perhaps in how they are able to navigate an application with the
        standard set of controls afforded to them, or use my background knowledge of how
        different cultures communicate in order to improve the user experience of an
        application that depends on intuitive controls rather than a manual.</p>

        <p>I have used my experience in my advanced mathematics courses more than anything
        when I was able to model a simple physics engine in a web based application for a
        personal "sandbox" project. I was able to define the state of objects moving through
        a virtual space based on specific parameters, such as position and inertia, in order
        to improve the performance of the application greatly through predictive pathing.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3>

        <p>Iowa State University has, through group based classes such as 309 and 329,
        taught me many valuable lessons in working in a group. Not the least of which is
        how to balance working with and managing peers in the case that there is a large
        disparity in the technical knowledge between group members. This includes
        identifying strengths and delegating tasks to group members based on them. It also
        includes being able to take people of differing skill sets and break a problem into
        assignable portions so that individuals can come together as a group to work towards
        a common goal.</p>

        <p>The open-ended and free nature of the project based classes I took have granted
        me the ability to create projects and solve them from an engineering standpoint
        multiple times over. I was able to select a real world problem I wanted to solve,
        translate that into a project with specifications, and then break it down further
        into programmable parts that were abel to be delivered.</p>

        <p>In a global context, my ability to formulate engineering solutions have been
        honed so that I can contribute to the advancement of humanity and improve the
        lives of people for whom I create software. I am able to save people's time
        by automating tasks and save resources by optimizing solutions.</p>

        <p>My work in groups at ISU has greatly improved my ability to take that
        experience to the real world and work in groups both professionally and
        personally. I have learned the importance of quickly identifying the
        strengths that each member brings to the team and how to harness those in order
        to create an environment where everyone can feel as though they are a contributing
        member fo the team, which increases output and makes everyone involved happier.</p>

        <p>In trying to come up with problems to solve for my project based classes,
        I have been able to identify pain points in everyday life and use the issues
        to make ideas for interesting projects or products that could be created to
        solve them. For example, I hate doing jigsaw puzzles, so I thought that it would
        be helpful to create an image processing app that could help identify where pieces
        should go so that they can be solved quickly and with more efficiency.</p>

        <p>I am better able to understand my professional and ethical responsibilities
        after my time at ISU since I have learned how to abide my a standard code of
        ethics such as those set forth by IEEE. I am able to recognize why these
        statutes exist and how abiding by them is a benefit for me and everyone who I
        associate with.</p>

        <p>In my classes, I was always able to use the expertize of the faculty in
        order to complete the required work. I could depend on the resources that were
        afforded to me by the labs and library in order to use software that was helpful
        to me in the completion and compilation of programs that I was tasked with during
        my time here.</p>

        <p>My Undergraduate Research experience and experience at ISU sponsored career
        fairs helped shape my view of how to approach real world problems. Through my
        research I was able to take a more academic view of problems and behaviors that
        I was experiencing in my life and understand the more theoretical basis behind
        them. From my experience in the career fair I was able to better see who I was
        in the eyes of the professional world and be more aware of my self in that context.</p>

        <p>I have pursued multiple internship experiences in order to improve my ability
        to apply my academic knowledge to a professional rather than an academic environment.
        In these situations, functionality is imposed upon the team rather than supplied
        for the express purpose of learning as in the more academic contexts. I have also
        started many different personal projects in order to fill in the gaps in what
        my academic experience and internships are able to provide.</p>

        <p>The main thing that I would change if I were to complete my undergraduate
        work again would to be more active in the student organizations and depend on
        my academic peers in order to use what they hae learned in order to have a
        more balanced and full understanding of my courses.</p>
