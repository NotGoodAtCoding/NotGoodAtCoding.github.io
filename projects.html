        <h3>Office Announcements Board</h3>
        <p><strong>The Office Announcements board</strong>, codenamed Denko-Board, was a project that I
        worked on with a coworker during my time at Maverick Software Consulting. The
        Purpose of the project was to provide a kiosk-style webpage that would display
        news, weather, and music feeds for the office, as well as announcements that
        could be set by the manager.</p>
        <p><strong>My Role: </strong>I was a secondary developer on the project, and my main role was
        to maintain the server and add the weather functionality to the frontend. I also set up the
        Raspberry Pi server to run autonomously so that future users could simply plug it in
        to the power and the internet and it would automatically start serving.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Members: </strong>2</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies: </strong> a Node.js server with an Angular/ Bootstrap frontend
        that ran autonomously on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian (a debian distro)</p>
        <p><strong>Experience gained: </strong>This was my first exposure to web development,
        including Javascript and the entire process of running a server that serves webpages.
        I also learned a great deal about linux, including installation, setup, basic commands,
        and cron.</p>

        <h3>QWOP AI</h3>
        <p><strong>The QWOP AI</strong>, or "Forrest Grump," is a machine learning project that
        aimed to make a program that could learn how to play the flash game
            <a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>
        via interactions and data from the game played in a web browser. The project ended with
        moderate success, as most of the time the runner avatar would "learn" how to slowly advance.</p>
        <p><strong>My Role: </strong>I was tasked with implementing the Q-learning model, parsing
        information from the game via taking images and parsing out various bits of data, and
        driving interaction with the game via Selenium Webdriver.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Members: </strong>4</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies: </strong> Java, using Selenium Webdriver to interact with the game
        through Chrome browser.</p>
        <p><strong>Experience gained: </strong>I learned a huge amount about machine learning and
        specifically the Q-learning model. I also learned some more advanced techniques with
        Selenium Webdriver, and I wrote some rudimentary image processing and practiced optimization
        of algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Better BlackBoard</h3>
        <p><strong>Better BlackBoard</strong> is a project that aims to "do right" all of the things
        that are frustrating or broken on the ISU Blackboard page and application, such as UI
        responsiveness, Browser support, various UI bugs or poor design, and extra features
        aimed at incorporating other services that students have to use for certain classes,
        such as Piazza and TopHat.</p>
        <p><strong>My Role: </strong>I am the sole developer on this project, which has gone through
        a few iterations.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Members: </strong>1</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies: </strong>Node.js server with a (temporary) Firebase DB, attached
        to a UI that runs on React for the web and React Native for Android and iOS mobile
        devices. This React frontend also uses a Flux style dataflow pattern, specifically redux.</p>
        <p><strong>Experience gained: </strong>This project has been instrumental for me
        in learning and keeping up with new versions of Javascript and frontend frameworks.
        It is also a good way of applying the things I learn at my Internship to a different
        project so I can expand on what I know even more.</p>
