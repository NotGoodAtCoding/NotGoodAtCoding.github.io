        <h3>Work Experience</h3>

        <h5>Workiva</h5>
        <p>I am currently employed as an intern at Workiva, and have been since February 2016.
        In my position, I work in a small team of myself, one other intern, and a senior architect
        on an internal tool to provide vital information on the health of services and
        projects that other members of the organization use and contribute to
        every day. I am able to work on both the server and client side code which
        allows me to have a great diversified skill set in both server based coding
        and UI development.</p>
        <p><b>Skills: </b>Python, Dart, React, Flux, and Google App Engine. Agile
        development and professionalism.</p>
        <p><b>Final Product: </b>The product is still in development, but we have monthly
        product reviews in which I and my team present the new features that we have
        created to a large portion of the organization.</p>
        <p>From this experience I have learned so much in such a small amount of time. I
        have learned a huge amount about the Agile Development process, as well as more
        technical skills with languages such as Python and Dart and tools such as Google
        App Engine, Git, and various build and deployment tools.</p>

        <h5>Maverick Software Consulting</h5>
        <p>I was employed as a Software Consultant at Maverick Software from December 2014 until
        February 2016. In this position, I was in charge of my own Web Automation Regression
        Test Suite that was used to test a specific portion of an internal site for
        Thomson Reuters. I had a lot of autonomy in this position, which allowed me to
        figure out things for myself and learn from my mistakes. </p>
        <p><b>Skills: </b>Java, Selenium, XML, XPath.</p>
        <p><b>Final Product: </b>The final project that I lef the company with was a full
        test suite that would fully test the site, including the database and various
        functions of the site.</p>
        <p>From this experience I was able to learn the importance of automated testing and
        design of test systems, as well as how to properly parse XML documents with a certain
        level of tolerance and flexibility.</p>
