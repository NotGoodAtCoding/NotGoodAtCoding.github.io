        <h3>Horizontal vs. Vertical Team Structure</h3>
        <p>Tags: wagie</p>
        <p>TL;DR: More like what don't I do here</p>
        <p>
            Preface: This is not about ORGANIZATION structure where there
            are already tons of articles around a trendy way of having a
            "no-hierarchy" org which I do not find very helpful since 
            in my humble experience, hierarchical structures will form
            regardless of formal definition in an internal employee
            reporting chain. This is about IC-first teams operating in
            different modes within a larger organization. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most teams I have been on have this structure, more or less
            with some exceptions that are not particularly important
            for the purposes of this post:<br>
            (PM) Product Manager: Handles direction (customer feedback loops, 
            strategic paths), consults with other workstreams,
            major part in organizing incoming work items.<br>
            (EM) Engineering Manager: Can be involved in tactical paths with senior ICs,
            day-to-day soft skills with, well, managing ICs.<br>
            (TL) Tech Lead: Highly involved in both consulting the feasibility
            and development cost when evaluating strategic and
            tactical paths, may do architectural design.<br>
            (IC) Individual Contributor: Mostly there to churn out code.
        </p>
        <p>
            This, in my limited experience, is a vertical team structure. Each
            member has a very narrow set of responsibilities which means they
            can specialize without having to over-extend their realm of
            competency. In this structure, one of the main bottlenecks is
            communication, since all work has to go through multiple units
            in order to eventually be done by the IC. In extreme cases, this
            becomes excruciating, particularly for senior ICs with high
            capacity for cross-discipline work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Digression: not-quite-hyperbole of a highly vertical team. The
            PM starts a cycle of new work intake. This reconciles their
            strategy with evidence such as retrospective and forward-looking
            feedback i.e. customer complaints and direct feature asks. This
            incoming strategy is discussed with the TL in order to set
            feasibility and expected dev cost for prioritization purposes.
            Once the strategy is set, the EM and TL can start work on the
            tactical paths for delivering the larger strategic goal. Then,
            work is portioned out in as large or small tasks as the ICs
            are comfortable with and they work to deliver.
        </p>

        <h3>How to make performance review not suck</h3>
        <p>Tags: productivity</p>
        <p>TL;DR: babysit yourself</p>
        <p>
            I hear a lot of complaints around performance review, particularly
            that it is difficult to remember tasks completed, time consuming
            to report, and generally annoying (isn't it my manager's job to
            know everything that I've done and make a little report and send
            it for promo automagically? (no.))<br>
            You are responsible for your own tracking, accountability, and
            upwards reporting as part of being a high functioning autonomous
            IC, which is what we should all strive for. (digression: high
            autonomy IC is the goal)<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            If you followed the steps in Async Standups, then you already have the
            framework for any performance review. Subdivide your time into relevant
            frames, typically [day, week, quarter] to track and filter notable
            achievements. Each frame should only take a few minutes to complete. I
            have wrapper routines around my tasks in order to make them more efficient
            and keep in a good uninterrupted flow. This not only allows accomplishments
            to bubble up, but also gameifies my day leading to a better sense of
            accomplishment and overall contentment.
        </p>
        <p>
            My optimal taskflow wrapping is: <br>
            Reference daily goals to set task<br>
            ??? task ??? <br>
            Record that the task is done both externally (i.e. outward facing work tracking apps)
            and then internally on my todo tracker.<br>
            Human necessary tasks (water intake / output, mobility operation,
            timeboxed existential crisis, snacks, etc.)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            By making tracking part of your workflow, you avoid having to scramble
            later to remember all the tasks you completed. This works particularly
            well for tasks that are not easily tracked or that do not have
            artifacts (digression: Horizontal Org work; wtf am I doing?) and while
            it may be nice to just use a query on your work tracker (get where 
            assignee=me and completed>-3months) I still prefer tracking in this way
            for the following reasons:<br>
            Not all work is accurately tracked in the software<br>
            Work item documentation can vary wildly<br>
            Not all things I do are tracked (don't argue that they should be)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            By implementing quick self-tracking tasks, I have increased my daily
            flow and made it much easier to track and report performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Async Standups</h3>
        <p>Tags: productivity</p>
        <p>TL;DR: You should have your standup meetings asynchronously in chat. </p>
        <p>
            Most of the time spent in standup meetings is wasted. 
            Here's a simple test you can do: at the end of your next synchronous
            standup meeting, test either yourself (or another team member, if 
            you're feeling spicy) on another's update. Most likely, they will not
            remember and even if they do, they probably don't care. ICs are
            unlikely to sit idle, which means they will be distractedly working
            at best or just killing time after being interrupted from focus time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standups quickly turn into a productivity check which isn't relevant
            for anyone other than your Engineering Manager, and even then a 15-30
            minute meeting every day to check that your engineers are doing their
            job is a waste of time. EMs should be able to trust ICs at a daily
            timescale.<br>
            The standup meeting should be reduced to the most relevant info in
            order of importance:<br><br>
            0. Asks for the team i.e. code reviews, general questions (though you
            should wonder why this wasn't asked async in team chat)<br>
            1. Changes since last standup or that are planned for the day that
            directly affect the team i.e. API updates <br>
            2. Adhoc discussions, preferably as breakouts with only those relevant to the conversation
        </p>

        <p>
            Enjoy getting 15-30+ minutes back per day.
        </p>
