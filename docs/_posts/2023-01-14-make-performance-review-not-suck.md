I hear a lot of complaints around performance review, particularly that it is difficult to remember tasks completed, time consuming to report, and generally annoying (isn't it my manager's job to know everything that I've done and make a little report and send it for promo automagically? (no.)) 

You are responsible for your own tracking, accountability, and upwards reporting as part of being a high functioning autonomous IC, which is what we should all strive for.

If you followed the steps in [async standups](/productivity/2023/01/14/async-standups.html), then you already have the framework for any performance review. Subdivide your time into relevant frames, typically [day, week, quarter] to track and filter notable achievements. Each frame should only take a few minutes to complete. I have wrapper routines around my tasks in order to make them more efficient and keep in a good uninterrupted flow. This not only allows accomplishments to bubble up, but also gameifies my day leading to a better sense of accomplishment and overall contentment.

My optimal taskflow wrapping is:  
- Reference daily goals to set task 
- ??? **task** ???  
- Record that the task is done both externally (i.e. outward facing work tracking apps)
and then internally on my todo tracker. 
- Optional human necessary tasks (water intake / output, mobility operation,
timeboxed existential crisis, snacks, etc.) 

This is a useful application of [habit stacking](https://jamesclear.com/habit-stacking) but with the added "pre-task" step (or just stacking two habits sequentially).

By making tracking part of your workflow, you avoid having to scramble later to remember all the tasks you completed. This works particularly well for tasks that are not easily tracked or that do not have artifacts and while it may be nice to just use a query on your work tracker (get where assignee=me and completed>-3months) 

I still prefer tracking in this way for the following reasons: 
- Not all work is accurately tracked in the software 
- Work item documentation can vary wildly 
- Not all things I do are tracked (don't argue that they should be) 

By implementing quick self-tracking tasks, I have increased my daily flow and made it much easier to track and report performance.
