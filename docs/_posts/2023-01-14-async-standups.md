> TL;DR: Have your standup meetings in chat.

Most of the time spent in standup meetings is wasted. 
Here's a simple test you can do: at the end of your next synchronous
standup meeting, test either yourself (or another team member, if 
you're feeling spicy) on another's update. Most likely, they will not
remember and even if they do, they probably don't care. ICs are
unlikely to sit idle, which means they will be distractedly working
at best or just killing time after being interrupted from focus time.

Standups quickly turn into a productivity check which isn't relevant
for anyone other than your Engineering Manager, and even then a 15-30
minute meeting every day to check that your engineers are doing their
job is a waste of time. EMs should be able to trust ICs at a daily
timescale.

The standup meeting should be reduced to the most relevant info in
order of importance:


0. Asks for the team i.e. code reviews, general questions (though you
should wonder why this wasn't asked async in team chat)
1. Changes since last standup or that are planned for the day that
directly affect the team i.e. API updates 
2. Adhoc discussions, preferably as breakouts with only those relevant to the conversation

Enjoy getting 15-30+ minutes back per day.
